This package acts as a typescript wrapper on top of the Ston.fi [Omniston protocol](https://github.com/ston-fi/omniston-api). It uses [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev) to provide observables on top of the WebSocket API connection

You can find all supported methods in our [docs](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/omniston) or take a look onto our [demo app](https://github.com/ston-fi/omniston-sdk/tree/main/examples/next-js-app) that use NextJs and `omniston-sdk-react` package
